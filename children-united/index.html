<p class="lead">At Yoomee I worked with Save the Children and First News to create a website aimed at helping Children connect with other Children across the globe.
The initial site consisted of a redesign of the landing page, expanding the site to blog and survey for children.
</p>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/portfolio/{{ page.img2 }}" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.alt }}">

<p>The First news colour palette was limited to two colours.
So to bring more variety and excitement to the site I chose strong vibrant colours to compliment the primary colours that already existed.</p>
