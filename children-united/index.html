<p class="lead">At Yoomee I worked on an agile project for Children United, a collaborative between Save the Children and First News, and Achievement for all. They wanted to help connect a global community of educated children to take collective action in order to change their world. </p>
<p>I worked on planning the UX, design and front end for the microsite.

  Understading the importance of sharing the message I created a pack of assets for them to promote their rebrand across all the major social media channels and print, and this helped to improve the awareness of Children United, and increase their followers.
