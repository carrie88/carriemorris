<p class="lead"> Monowriter is a project i'm working on in my spare time with my husband, Simon. We both work on the plan, I design and  he works on the development of the tool.
<p class="lead">It began with an idea to create a writing tool that could be one tool for everything, for anything that could be written, with a need for structure. It aims to eliminate the blank canvas with space to gather inspiration, and a space to plot the structure of your piece with story blocks that use a character limit to keep focus tight. and, most importantly a switch to story mode, allowing you to reference your plot as you write the story.</p>
