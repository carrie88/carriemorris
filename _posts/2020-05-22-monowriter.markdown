<p class="lead"> Monowriter is a project i'm working on in my spare time with my husband, who is working on the development of the tool.
<p class="lead">I wanted to create a writing tool that would be one tool for everything you could need to get writing a storyboard for an animation, a project. Eliminate the blank canvas with space to put your inspiration images. Plot a pice with story blocks that force a character limit to keep focus tight, and a switch view, allowinng you to reference your plot as you write the story.</p>
