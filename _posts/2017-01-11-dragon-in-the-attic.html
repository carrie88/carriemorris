<p class="lead">Dragon in the Attic is a game aimed at children aged 6-12 designed to encourage them to think about bullying and their health choices through a character driven concept. The initial concept was created by children for a Schools App Challenge. I was the design lead for the project, working on the character design, game assets and helped to make their idea into an app with storyboarding, research and development. I also worked on building the app using Gamesalad.</p>
