<p class="lead">At Yoomee I worked on Children United, a collaboration between Save the Children,
   First News and Achievement for all. They wanted to help connect a global community of educated
   children to take collective action in order to change their world.
   <p> I worked on the planning the journey, graphic design and front-end build of the website.</p>
    <p>The website needed to have pages aimed at different age groups which was a challenge in terms of UX.
    The childrens homepage area features a fun drag and drop questionnaire where the user can arrange and prioritise
      the world issues most important to them. The data was collected and displayed on a dynamic infographic
      page, which I also designed.
