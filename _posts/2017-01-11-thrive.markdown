  Thrive is a wesbite aimed at teenagers to keep them informed and provide them with advice about mental health.
  At Yoomee, I worked on the design and the development of the website which is built in Jekyll, and did two rounds of user testing
  with a range of young people in Bradford. Its rewarding to see young people finding it a useful, easy to use resource.

<p>I also worked on press material to go out at launch, including business cards and posters.</p>
