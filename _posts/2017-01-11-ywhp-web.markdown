  Young Womens Housing Project approached me to help them refresh their brand identity and tell their stories on the web using a CMS platform.
  I helped them develop their branding to focus on the amazing support work they do with a new lockup, styleguide, website and print materials.

      The first thing that made me feel as though our partnership was going to work was that Carrie listened. Really listened to who we were, what we did, why YWHP Sheffield is a really important service and how we are uniquely placed to deliver the support we deliver. This was the bedrock to being able to work at the pace we needed to work at - Carrie was very flexible & patient! â€“ and to provide us with a refreshed branding and website that looks great, says what we need it to say and has given us the confidence to step out and shout about what we do.
