<p class="lead">Healthy Island is a game aimed at children aged 7-11 encouraging them to think about their health and wellbeing through a series of quizzes and minigames. I played a leading role on the UX and design direction for the app whilst building some of the mini-games and other game screens in Gamesalad. I also managed the testing and release of the app.</p>
